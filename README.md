## About The Project

The challenge was to build a system for startups registration. I created a home, login, signup, create company and edit company screens. The site is responsive. This is the front end of the application. To access the back end, go to the following repository: https://github.com/fabriciopolato/100-open-backend. 

### Built With:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [ReactJS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) - Uma biblioteca JavaScript para criar interfaces de usu√°rio.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.
